He hailed from the Bhosle Maratha clan, which had a rich history of valor and military service. Shivaji’s father, Shahaji Bhosle, served as a general in the Bijapur Sultanate, while his mother, Jijabai, instilled in him a deep sense of pride in his Maratha heritage.\n\nInfluences and Education\n\nDuring his formative years, Shivaji was exposed to stories of valor and bravery from the great Hindu epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. These tales, along with the teachings of his mother and the guidance of knowledgeable scholars, instilled in him a sense of duty towards his people and a fervent desire to establish a kingdom free from foreign rule.\n\nRise to Power\nEstablishing Swarajya\n\nA young Shivaji embarked on his mission to establish “Swarajya,” a self-governing kingdom. He organized a group of trusted associates known as the “Mavlas” and began liberating strategic forts from the control of the oppressive Adilshahi and Mughal forces. His early victories, such as the capture of Torna Fort in 1646, laid the foundation for his future successes.\n\nStrategies and Military Tactics\n\nShivaji Maharaj was a master strategist and tactician.

Just seven months ago, on November 19, 2023, India had suffered an heart-wrenching loss against Australia at Ahmedabad despite being the most-dominant team on ICC Mens Cricket World Cup 2023. Today was the much-needed redemption for every cricket fanatic in the country! Team India clinched their second T20 World Cup on Saturday by defeating South Africa in an emotion-filled final, ending an 11-year global trophy drought. Virat Kohli’s 76 runs and key bowling performances by Arshdeep Singh and Jasprit Bumrah helped India secure the victory by seven runs. Unfortunately for South Africa, their late-stage chocking at major tournaments continued as the team faltered in the crucial stages of the match despite being ahead in the game for over three quarters of the second innings. Indias win brought back memories of their first T20 World Cup in 2007 under MS Dhoni and marked their first global victory since the 2013 Champions Trophy. Kohli anchored the first innings with a steady 76 off 59 balls, enabling India to reach a competitive total of 176 for seven. Key partnerships, particularly with Axar Patel, steadied India’s innings after early setbacks. South Africa, playing in their first World Cup final, fought back with Heinrich Klaasen’s 52 off 27 balls, but Indian bowlers managed to control the game’s final moments. Hardik Pandya’s crucial dismissal of Klaasen in the 17th over swayed the momentum back to India. Historic clash opens emotional floodgates The T20I World Cup 2024 finals was not just any other international outing. It marked the end of an era for the Indian cricket team, as it marked the end of T20I career for the two legendary batters, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. Both players fought tears as they hugged teammates, spoke with broadcasters, and wrapped the Indian flag proudly around them.

Commentators remarked that such fervent celebration from the usually composed Dravid underline the weight of this victory for team India. Rohit Sharma, India’s captain, finally had his moment after previous near-misses in World Cup finals. He said, No better time to say goodbye to this format. Ive loved every moment of this. This is what I wanted - I wanted to win the cup. Virat Kohli also echoed similar sentiments as he said, “It’s time for the next generation to take over. It was an open secret and I would have announced it even if we had lost.No better time to say goodbye to this format: Rohit Sharma joins Virat Kohli in biding farewell to T20I No better time to say goodbye to this format Rohit Sharma joins Virat Kohli in biding farewell to T20I Hardik Pandya, who had a struggling six months on both personal and professional fronts, defended 16 runs in the last over. With Klaasens dismissal and sealing India’s triumph in the last over, he could not hold back his tears as teammates celebrated with joy. But the final moments were also marked by contrasting emotions. David Millers shot in the last over was caught by Suryakumar Yadav, dashing South Africa’s hopes and cementing India’s win. The South African dug out displayed despair and agony as the momentum turned swiftly towards India during the final overs. Gutted for the time being. Itll take some time for us to have a really good reflection on a really good campaign the group had. Obviously, for the time being, like I mentioned, it hurts quite a bit.
